## 📂 Contents

- `Main_artificialData.m` – reproduces results for artificial examples **L.1–L.4** from the paper.
- `Main_RealData.m` – processes and analyzes real population data from Jackson *et al.*

## 🔬 Artificial Data (L.1–L.4)

These examples use synthetic data for structured population models and can be run directly using the provided scripts.

⚠️ The datasets for the nonlinear examples (e.g., NL.1–NL.2) are too large to be hosted on GitHub.  
If you are interested in running these examples, please contact the authors to request access.

## 📊 Real Population Data

The script `Main_RealData.m` uses empirical demographic data from the following study:

> **Changes in age-structure over four decades were a key determinant of population growth rate in a long-lived mammal**  
> J. Jackson, M. Coulson, L. Börger, et al.  
> *Journal of Animal Ecology*  
> [DOI: 10.1111/1365-2656.13290](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13290)
